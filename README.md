# kcore-rust

`kcore-rust` is a Rust control plane for declarative VM lifecycle management on NixOS hosts.
It is organized as a multi-crate workspace with a controller, node agent, and CLI.

## Licensing and editions

kcore Community Edition is open source under the **Apache License 2.0** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). The core platform remains open and buildable from source. **Commercial use of that Apache-2.0 code is not restricted by us** beyond what the licence states.

More detail: [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md).

## Commercial subscriptions

Organizations that want the **official supported distribution** of kcore can purchase a subscription. Subscriptions provide access to **official signed ISO images**, the **stable production update channel**, **tested updates**, and **commercial support**.

## Community Edition

Community Edition is suitable for **contributors**, **labs**, **homelabs**, and **evaluation** environments. No subscription is required to build or run from source.

## Production use

For **production** environments, **kcore Standard** or **kcore Premium** is **recommended**.

## Pricing

- **Standard** — £295 / year / CPU socket  
- **Premium** — £695 / year / CPU socket  

Full tier definitions, support limits, and billing rules: **[PRICING.md](PRICING.md)**.

## Pricing model

Pricing is based on **physical CPU sockets**, not CPU cores. Each occupied CPU socket on each subscribed node requires a subscription. For production clusters, **all nodes should be subscribed at the same level** for repository consistency and support eligibility.

## Licensing FAQ

**Is kcore open source?**  
Yes. The Community Edition core is under **Apache-2.0**.

**Can I use kcore without a subscription?**  
Yes. You can build and use Community Edition from source without a subscription. Subscriptions apply to the official supported distribution, stable production updates, signed ISOs, and support—not to permission to use the open-source core.

**What does a subscription include?**  
See [PRICING.md](PRICING.md). In short: the official supported distribution (signed ISOs, stable production channel, tested updates) and commercial support per tier.

**How is pricing calculated?**  
Per **physical CPU socket**, not per core (see [PRICING.md](PRICING.md)).

## Current Project State

- Declarative VM lifecycle is implemented end-to-end (`create/delete/set desired state` -> controller DB -> generated Nix -> node apply).
- Runtime transport security uses mTLS between `kctl`, `kcore-controller`, and `kcore-node-agent` when TLS is configured.
- Certificate Common Name (CN)-based authorization is enforced per gRPC method in secure mode.
- Node installation bootstraps cluster PKI material into `/etc/kcore/certs` on installed systems.
- Cloud Hypervisor runtime status is surfaced from node-agent via API sockets under `/run/kcore`.

## Components

- `kcore-controller`: gRPC orchestration API, SQLite-backed desired state, scheduler, and Nix config rendering/push.
- `kcore-node-agent`: node-side gRPC service for admin operations, config apply, install flow, and VM runtime visibility.
- `kctl`: operator CLI for cluster PKI setup, VM lifecycle, node install/admin operations, and image operations.

## Architecture Snapshot

- `kctl` sends intent to controller (and can call node-agent directly for node-scoped operations).
- Controller persists desired state, selects target nodes, and renders `ch-vm.vms` with `nixgen`.
- Node-agent writes generated config, runs `nixos-rebuild`, and reports runtime state back to controller.
- VM networking and units are realized by the `ch-vm` module and executed by `cloud-hypervisor`.

See: [Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)

## Security Snapshot

- mTLS is the default production posture; insecure mode is opt-in via `--allow-insecure` / `--insecure`.
- Cluster PKI is created by `kctl create cluster`.
- Node install flow sends only required cert/key material to target nodes; private key files are written with restricted permissions.
- Known security work still pending: certificate rotation workflows, revocation checks (CRL/OCSP), and finer-grained authorization policies.

See: [Security model](docs/security.md)

## Operator Workflows

- Initialize cluster PKI/context: `kctl create cluster --controller <host:9090>`
- Install nodes from live ISO: `kctl --node <host:9091> node install ...`
- Create VMs with a direct HTTPS image URL + checksum:
  `kctl create vm <name> --storage-backend <filesystem|lvm|zfs> --storage-size-bytes <bytes> --image <https-url> --image-sha256 <sha256>`
- Create VMs from node-local uploaded image path:
  `kctl --node <host:9091> node upload-image -f <local-image.{qcow2,raw}> ...`
  then `kctl create vm <name> --storage-backend <filesystem|lvm|zfs> --storage-size-bytes <bytes> --image-path <node-path> --image-format <qcow2|raw>`
- Wait for VM readiness:
  `kctl create vm <name> ... --wait` or `kctl create vm <name> ... --wait-for-ssh`
- Manage VM desired state declaratively: `kctl set vm <name> --state <running|stopped>`
- Legacy compatibility aliases remain available: `kctl start vm ...`, `kctl stop vm ...`

Cloud Hypervisor console endpoints:
- API socket: `/run/kcore/<vm-name>.sock`
- Serial socket: `/run/kcore/<vm-name>.serial.sock`
- Example attach from node host: `socat -,raw,echo=0,icanon=0 UNIX-CONNECT:/run/kcore/<vm-name>.serial.sock`

Default guest access on generated cloud-init seeds:
- DHCP leases are served by `kcore-dhcp-<network>.service` and written to `/run/kcore/dnsmasq-<network>.leases`.
- Default VM user is `kcore` with password `kcore` (for first-boot/operator debugging).
- Example from node host:
  `ssh kcore@$(awk 'NR==1 {print $3}' /run/kcore/dnsmasq-default.leases)`

## Developer Workflow

Use the Nix flake development environment for reproducible toolchains:

```bash
nix develop
```

Common checks:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo audit
```

## Known Gaps / Next Priorities

1. Add certificate lifecycle management (rotation, expiry handling, revocation strategy).
2. Implement robust state reconciliation for VM runtime sync paths.
3. Improve scheduler policy (capacity/affinity/load-aware placement).
4. Expand integration and failure-mode test coverage across controller/node interactions.
