# Security: Kubernetes vs kcore

This document compares the security model of Kubernetes with kcore's current
implementation. The goal is transparency about what kcore does and does not
provide, and to guide future hardening work.

## Trust Model

**Kubernetes** uses a multi-layered trust model designed for multi-tenant
environments running untrusted workloads. Identity is established through
service accounts, RBAC policies, and certificate signing requests (CSRs)
that go through an approval workflow.

**kcore** uses a simpler single-operator model. Trust is rooted in a shared
CA whose private key lives on the operator's machine. Certificates signed
by that CA grant access; the Common Name (CN) in the certificate determines
the role (`kcore-controller`, `kcore-kctl`, or `kcore-node-<host>`).

## Certificate and Identity Management

| Area | Kubernetes | kcore |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Bootstrap | TLS Bootstrap with short-lived tokens (24h default). Node submits a CSR; the control plane signs it. Token expires automatically. | Operator pushes a CA-signed cert directly to the node during `kctl node install`. No bootstrap token. |
| Cert rotation | kubelet auto-renews its certificate before expiry. Built into the kubelet. | Automatic renewal via sub-CA: node-agent checks expiry daily, renews within 30 days of expiry via `RenewNodeCert` RPC. Controller cert can be rotated with `kctl rotate certs`. Sub-CA rotatable with `kctl rotate sub-ca`. |
| Revocation | Can deny CSR renewals, delete the node object, or rotate the CA. RBAC blocks access immediately. | Sub-CA can be revoked by rotating it (`kctl rotate sub-ca`). Only approved nodes can renew. The root CA can be regenerated as a last resort. |
| Identity granularity | Each component has a distinct service account with RBAC bindings. Least-privilege by default. | Three CN-based roles: controller, kctl, and node. No fine-grained permissions within a role. |

### How kcore bootstrap works

1. Operator runs `kctl create cluster --controller <ip:port>` on their
   local machine. This generates a self-signed CA, a controller cert
   (with the controller IP as a SAN), and a kctl client cert.
2. When adding a node, `kctl node install --join-controller <ip:port>`
   signs a fresh node certificate using the local CA key and pushes it
   (along with the CA cert) to the node over gRPC.
3. After reboot, the node-agent uses its cert to establish mTLS with the
   controller and self-registers.

The security boundary is the CA private key stored at
`~/.kcore/<context>/ca.key`. Whoever possesses it can add nodes to the
cluster.

## Node Lifecycle

| Area | Kubernetes | kcore |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Admission | Node CSR must be approved (automatically or manually). Node object is created only after approval. | New nodes register as `pending` and require operator approval (`kctl node approve`). Rejected nodes cannot participate. |
| Heartbeat | kubelet sends periodic leases. After `node-monitor-grace-period` (40s default) the node is marked `NotReady`. Pods get evicted after `pod-eviction-timeout`. | Heartbeat mechanism exists but there is no automatic VM migration when a node becomes unreachable. |
| Graceful removal | `kubectl drain` cordons the node and evicts pods respecting PodDisruptionBudgets. `kubectl delete node` removes the identity. | `kctl drain node` migrates VMs but there is no cordon (prevent new scheduling without draining). Deleting a node from the DB does not invalidate its certificate. |

---

## API Security

| Area | Kubernetes | kcore |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Authorization | RBAC with Roles, ClusterRoles, and bindings. Per-resource, per-verb granularity (e.g., "this service account can only list pods in namespace X"). | CN-based: a connection is either kctl (full access), a node (node-level operations), or the controller. No middle ground. |
| Audit logging | Built-in audit log pipeline recording request metadata, response codes, and actor identity. Configurable verbosity levels. | Structured `tracing` logs exist but there is no dedicated audit trail of who performed which mutating action. |
| Admission control | Validating and mutating admission webhooks that can intercept any API request before persistence. | Validation happens inside gRPC handlers. No pluggable admission mechanism. |
| API versioning | Strict versioning (v1, v1beta1) with deprecation policy and conversion webhooks. | Protobuf fields are added in a backward-compatible way but there is no formal version negotiation or compatibility contract. |

---

## Secrets Management

| Area | Kubernetes | kcore |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Secrets storage | Dedicated Secret resource. Supports encryption at rest via KMS providers. Access is RBAC-scoped. | SSH public keys are stored in plaintext in SQLite. No general-purpose secrets management. |
| Workload identity | Automatic service account token mounting with short-lived projected tokens (bound service account tokens). | VMs do not receive identity tokens from the control plane. |

## What This Means in Practice

Most of the Kubernetes machinery described above exists because Kubernetes
is designed for **multi-tenant environments** running **untrusted
workloads**. kcore is a **single-operator bare-metal hypervisor**. The
threat model and practical priorities are different.

### Security measures already in place

- **mTLS everywhere**: all gRPC communication (controller to node, kctl to
  controller) requires mutual TLS authentication.
- **CA key stays local**: the CA private key never leaves the operator's
  machine. Only signed certificates are transmitted to nodes.
- **CN-based authorization**: the controller checks the certificate Common
  Name to enforce role separation (kctl vs node vs controller).
- **Node approval queue**: new nodes register as `pending` and must be
  approved by the operator (`kctl node approve <id>`) before they can
  participate in scheduling or heartbeats.
- **Sub-CA certificate auto-rotation**: a sub-CA (intermediate CA) is
  deployed to the controller. Nodes automatically renew their certificates
  within 30 days of expiry. The sub-CA is revocable by the operator
  (`kctl rotate sub-ca`) without affecting the root CA.
- **Certificate rotation commands**: `kctl rotate certs` re-signs the
  controller certificate; `kctl rotate sub-ca` generates a new sub-CA
  and pushes it to the controller.

### Planned improvements

1. **Audit log** -- structured log of all mutating API calls recording
   actor identity, action, resource, and timestamp. Essential for
   debugging and compliance.
2. **Cert expiry warning** -- `kctl get nodes` displays days until each
   node's certificate expires to prevent silent expiry.
3. **RBAC** -- multiple operator roles such as read-only, vm-admin, and
   cluster-admin with fine-grained permission control.

### Not planned (Kubernetes-specific complexity)

- **CSR approval flow** -- kcore controls the CA directly; a CSR workflow
  adds complexity without meaningful benefit for a single-operator model.
- **Admission webhooks** -- no plugin ecosystem to justify the abstraction.
- **API versioning** -- single codebase with all components deployed
  together; protocol compatibility is maintained through additive protobuf
  changes.
