# KCore Compliance Enablement Evaluation

How KCore should be designed so that customers can achieve GDPR, SOC 2, PCI DSS, FIPS 140-3, and related compliance — without KCore itself being the certified entity.

## Framing: platform compliance vs. customer compliance

KCore is infrastructure software. It manages VMs on bare-metal NixOS nodes using cloud-hypervisor. The customers who deploy KCore are the ones who need certifications — to satisfy their own auditors, regulators, or enterprise buyers.

KCore's role is to be a **compliance-enabling platform**: it provides the security controls, APIs, audit trails, isolation guarantees, and documentation that allow a customer's assessor to check the box. KCore is not itself SOC 2 certified or PCI compliant — but a customer running workloads on KCore can be, if KCore gives them the right tools.

This is the same model used by AWS, GCP, and Azure: the cloud provider publishes a "shared responsibility model" and provides compliance artifacts. The customer inherits the platform controls and builds their own compliance on top.

---

## 1. What KCore already provides

### 1.1 Encryption in transit

All inter-component communication uses mutual TLS (mTLS) with a self-managed PKI:

| Connection | Protocol | Authentication |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| kctl → controller | gRPC over mTLS | Client cert (CN: `kcore-kctl`) |
| controller → node-agent | gRPC over mTLS | Client cert (CN: `kcore-controller`) |
| node-agent → controller | gRPC over mTLS | Client cert (CN: `kcore-node-<host>`) |

**Compliance relevance:**
- SOC 2 CC6.1 (encryption), PCI DSS 4.2 (strong cryptography in transit), GDPR Art. 32 (encryption), NCSC Principle 2 (asset protection)
- Customer evidence: "All management plane traffic is encrypted with TLS 1.2+ using mutual certificate authentication. No plaintext management traffic is possible in production configuration."

### 1.2 Identity and access control

Every gRPC method enforces caller identity via the certificate Common Name. The authorization table is hard-coded per RPC method:

- Node-scoped RPCs (RegisterNode, Heartbeat, SyncVmState) accept only `kcore-node-*` certificates
- Operator RPCs (CreateVm, DeleteVm, ListVms, etc.) accept only `kcore-kctl` certificates
- Admin RPCs (ApplyNixConfig) accept only `kcore-kctl`

**Compliance relevance:**
- SOC 2 CC6.3 (access control), PCI DSS 7 (restrict access), GDPR Art. 32 (access limitations)
- Customer evidence: "Every API call is authenticated by a client certificate issued by the cluster CA. Authorization is enforced per-method based on certificate identity."

### 1.3 VM isolation

Each VM runs in a separate cloud-hypervisor process with its own KVM instance:

- Separate memory address spaces via KVM hardware virtualization
- Separate TAP devices and bridge interfaces per network
- No shared filesystem between VMs (no virtio-fs by default)
- No inter-VM communication except through explicitly configured network bridges

**Compliance relevance:**
- PCI DSS 2.2 (system hardening), NCSC Principle 3 (separation between consumers), BSI-VS-AP-0019 (hypervisor isolation)
- Customer evidence: "Workloads run in hardware-isolated virtual machines. Each VM has a dedicated KVM instance, TAP device, and network namespace. No shared resources exist between VMs at the hypervisor level."

### 1.4 Declarative, auditable infrastructure

NixOS provides:

- Reproducible builds from a single flake
- Atomic system updates via `nixos-rebuild switch` (rollback on failure)
- Immutable Nix store (binaries cannot be modified in place)
- Every system configuration change is a new generation with a full dependency tree

**Compliance relevance:**
- SOC 2 CC8 (change management), PCI DSS 6.5 (secure development), NCSC Principle 5 (operational security)
- Customer evidence: "Infrastructure is defined declaratively. Every change produces a new immutable system generation. Rollback is atomic. No ad-hoc configuration drift is possible."

### 1.5 Input validation and injection prevention

All user-controlled strings interpolated into Nix expressions are escaped:

- `nix_escape()` prevents string injection (`"`, `\`, `${`)
- `sanitize_nix_attr_key()` restricts attribute names to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`
- Disk paths are validated against traversal attacks

**Compliance relevance:**
- PCI DSS 6.2 (secure coding), SOC 2 PI1 (processing integrity)
- Customer evidence: "All user input is validated and sanitized before being incorporated into system configurations. Injection attacks against the configuration pipeline are prevented by design."

### 1.6 Dependency auditing

`cargo audit` scans all Rust dependencies against the RustSec Advisory Database. It runs as part of `make check` and is available in the Nix development shell.

**Compliance relevance:**
- PCI DSS 6.3 (software inventory and vulnerability management), SOC 2 CC7 (monitoring)
- Customer evidence: "All third-party dependencies are audited against known vulnerability databases on every build."

### 1.7 Network segmentation

KCore supports three network types with distinct isolation properties:

| Type | Isolation | Cross-host | Use case |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| NAT | Full — VMs behind masquerade, no inbound except DNAT ports | No | Default workloads |
| Bridge | VMs on physical LAN — upstream firewall controls | No | Bare-metal-like access |
| VXLAN | Overlay L2 — isolated from host LAN, cross-host via UDP tunnel | Yes | Multi-node clusters |

Per-network firewall rules (nftables) are generated declaratively. VLAN tagging (802.1Q) provides L2 isolation when needed.

**Compliance relevance:**
- PCI DSS 1.3 (network segmentation), NCSC Principle 3 (separation), SOC 2 CC6.6 (network access)
- Customer evidence: "Workloads can be placed on isolated networks with configurable firewall rules, VLAN tags, and separate bridge interfaces. PCI-scoped VMs can be network-isolated from non-PCI workloads."

### 1.8 Node approval queue

Nodes must be explicitly approved by an operator (`kctl approve node`) before they can host workloads. Unapproved nodes cannot receive VM placements.

**Compliance relevance:**
- SOC 2 CC6.2 (asset management), PCI DSS 2.4 (system inventory)
- Customer evidence: "No compute node can join the cluster and receive workloads without explicit operator approval."

### 1.9 FIPS-compatible cryptography

All TLS connections use `aws-lc-rs` as the rustls crypto backend. `aws-lc-rs` wraps AWS-LC, which holds FIPS 140-3 validation (certificate #4816). At process startup each binary installs a custom `CryptoProvider` restricted to:

- TLS 1.3: AES-256-GCM-SHA384, AES-128-GCM-SHA256
- TLS 1.2: ECDHE-ECDSA/RSA with AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM
- Key exchange: secp384r1 (P-384), secp256r1 (P-256) only
- Excluded: ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519, RSA key exchange

Certificate generation (`rcgen`) also uses `aws-lc-rs` instead of `ring`.

**Compliance relevance:**
- FIPS 140-3 (cryptographic module validation), PCI DSS 4.2 (strong cryptography)
- Customer evidence: "All management plane TLS uses aws-lc-rs (AWS-LC FIPS 140-3 #4816) with FIPS-approved cipher suites. No non-FIPS algorithms are negotiable."

---

## 2. What KCore must add to enable customer compliance

### 2.1 Audit logging (all standards)

**What customers need:** An immutable, queryable record of who did what, when, and to which resource. Every assessor — SOC 2, PCI, GDPR, NCSC — will ask for this.

**What to build:**

| Component | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Audit event structure | `{ timestamp, actor_cn, action, resource_type, resource_id, outcome, source_ip, request_id }` |
| Capture points | Every gRPC handler in controller and node-agent emits an audit event before returning |
| Storage | Append-only log file, structured JSON, one event per line |
| Retention config | Configurable via `auditLog.retentionDays` in controller.yaml (default: 90) |
| API exposure | New gRPC RPC `ListAuditEvents(filter, pagination)` so customers can pull audit data into their SIEM |
| kctl command | `kctl cluster audit-log [--since <time>] [--actor <cn>] [--action <type>]` |

**Why this matters for customers:**
- SOC 2 CC7.2: "The entity monitors system components for anomalies" — requires access to audit logs
- PCI DSS 10.2: "Implement automated audit trails for all system components"
- GDPR Art. 30: "Records of processing activities"
- NCSC Principle 12: "Audit information provided to consumers"

Without this, no customer can pass any audit using KCore. This is the single most important missing piece.

**Effort estimate:** 2–3 weeks engineering. No external cost.

### 2.2 Exportable compliance evidence (all standards)

Customers' auditors need documentary evidence. KCore should generate this automatically.

**What to build:**

| Artifact | Format | Content |
|----------|--------|---------|
| SBOM | CycloneDX JSON | Every Rust crate + Nix package in the release |
| Crypto inventory | Markdown / JSON | TLS version, cipher suites, key sizes, crypto library used |
| Network topology export | JSON | All networks, bridges, firewall rules, VLAN/VXLAN config per node |
| Access control matrix | Markdown / JSON | RPC methods × allowed certificate CNs |
| System configuration snapshot | Nix expression | The exact NixOS configuration running on each node |
| Node inventory | JSON via `ListNodes` | All nodes, their approval status, capacity, labels |
| VM inventory | JSON via `ListVms` | All VMs, their state, network placement, creation time |

**kctl commands to add:**

```
kctl cluster compliance-report    # Generates a bundle of all artifacts above
kctl cluster sbom                 # Prints the SBOM
kctl cluster crypto-inventory     # Prints TLS config and cipher suites in use
```

**Why this matters for customers:**
- SOC 2 auditors request evidence packages; customers should not need to manually document KCore's controls
- PCI QSAs need network diagrams, access control documentation, and software inventories
- GDPR requires a Record of Processing Activities — the data inventory feeds into this

**Effort estimate:** 2–3 weeks engineering. No external cost.

### 2.3 Role-based access control (SOC 2, PCI, NCSC)

The current model has a single `kcore-kctl` identity with full access to all operator RPCs. Customers need granular roles.

**What to build:**

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | All RPCs including ApplyNixConfig, ApproveNode, DrainNode |
| `operator` | CreateVm, DeleteVm, SetVmDesiredState, CreateNetwork, DeleteNetwork |
| `viewer` | GetVm, ListVms, GetNode, ListNodes, ListNetworks, ListAuditEvents |

Implementation: encode the role in the certificate CN or a custom X.509 extension (e.g., `kcore-kctl-admin`, `kcore-kctl-viewer`). The auth module checks the role against the RPC method's required role.

**Why this matters for customers:**
- SOC 2 CC6.3: "Role-based access that limits users to their required functions"
- PCI DSS 7.1: "Limit access to system components to only those individuals whose job requires such access"
- NCSC Principle 9: "Secure user management"

**Effort estimate:** 1–2 weeks engineering. No external cost.

### 2.4 FIPS-compatible crypto configuration (FIPS, PCI) — IMPLEMENTED

KCore now uses FIPS-validated cryptography by default, without requiring a runtime flag.

**What was built:**

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Crypto provider switch | **Done.** `ring` replaced by `aws-lc-rs` as the `rustls` crypto backend in all three binaries (controller, node-agent, kctl). `rcgen` (certificate generation) also switched to `aws-lc-rs`. |
| FIPS cipher suites | **Done (default, no flag needed).** Each binary installs a custom `CryptoProvider` at startup restricting cipher suites to AES-GCM + ECDHE P-256/P-384 only. ChaCha20-Poly1305 and X25519 are excluded. |
| Crypto inventory API | **Done.** `kctl get compliance-report` exposes crypto library, cipher suites, key exchange groups, excluded algorithms, mTLS status, access control matrix, node/VM/network inventories with aggregate counts, certificate lifecycle details, and a per-node breakdown showing hostname, address, approval status, and cert expiry for every registered agent. |

**Active TLS configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Crypto library | `aws-lc-rs` (wraps AWS-LC, FIPS 140-3 certificate #4816) |
| TLS 1.3 cipher suites | `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` |
| TLS 1.2 cipher suites | `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` |
| Key exchange groups | `secp384r1` (P-384), `secp256r1` (P-256) |
| Excluded | ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519, RSA key exchange |

**Why this matters for customers:**
- The customer's FIPS certification covers their system, not KCore. But if KCore uses non-FIPS crypto under the hood, the customer cannot claim FIPS compliance for their stack.
- KCore does not need its own FIPS 140-3 certificate. It uses a pre-validated library and documents that fact.
- Customer evidence: "All management plane TLS uses aws-lc-rs (AWS-LC FIPS 140-3 #4816) with AES-GCM cipher suites and NIST P-256/P-384 key exchange. No non-FIPS algorithms are negotiable."

### 2.5 Encryption at rest (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI)

Customers need to demonstrate that data at rest is encrypted.

**Data classification:** KCore's controller SQLite database stores only operational metadata — node IPs, hostnames, VM definitions, network configurations, and certificate Common Names. It does **not** store personal data (GDPR), cardholder data (PCI DSS), or customer secrets. Therefore application-level database encryption (e.g. SQLCipher) is unnecessary and would add build complexity and key management burden for zero compliance value.

**Why full-disk encryption (LUKS) is sufficient:**

- **PCI DSS 4.0 Requirement 3.5.1.2** restricts disk-level-only encryption to removable media, but this applies specifically to stored PANs. The PCI SSC states: "Requirements 3.5–3.7 would not be applicable to systems that do not store or manage the storage of cardholder data." KCore never stores PANs.
- **SOC 2** is principle-based and does not prescribe specific encryption methods. Auditors evaluate whether the approach is appropriate for the data classification. LUKS on the host disk, combined with file permissions (0600) on certificate files and mTLS on the network, is a defensible position for infrastructure metadata.
- **GDPR Art. 32** requires "appropriate technical measures" proportional to risk. KCore stores no personal data. LUKS on the host disk protects operational metadata. Guest-level encryption for VMs containing personal data is the customer's responsibility.
- **FIPS 140-3** has no opinion on encryption at rest beyond requiring a validated module if encryption is used. LUKS uses the kernel's `dm-crypt` which operates in FIPS mode when the `fips=1` kernel parameter is set.

**What to provide:**

| Layer | Protection | Responsibility | Engineering effort |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Host disk (LUKS) | Full-disk encryption via dm-crypt/LUKS on NixOS nodes | Customer deploys using KCore's reference NixOS configuration | Documentation only |
| Certificate files | File permissions (0600) + LUKS | Already implemented | Already done |
| Controller SQLite DB | Protected by LUKS — no application-level encryption needed | N/A (operational metadata only) | None |
| VM guest disks | Guest-level LUKS for workloads with sensitive/personal/cardholder data | Customer's responsibility | Documentation only |

**Reference NixOS LUKS configuration:**

```nix
{
  boot.initrd.luks.devices."cryptroot" = {
    device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/<PARTITION-UUID>";
    preLVM = true;
    allowDiscards = true;                    # for SSD TRIM
    # Optional: FIDO2 hardware token unlock
    # fido2.credential = "<credential-id>";
  };

  fileSystems."/" = {
    device = "/dev/mapper/cryptroot";
    fsType = "ext4";
  };

  # For FIPS-mode kernel crypto (optional):
  # boot.kernelParams = [ "fips=1" ];
}
```

Customers should apply this to all KCore nodes. The `kctl node install` workflow does not currently automate LUKS setup — the operator must partition and encrypt the disk before running the installer, or use a pre-encrypted NixOS image.

**Why this matters for customers:**
- GDPR Art. 32: "encryption of personal data" — customer VMs with personal data use guest-level LUKS
- SOC 2 C1.1: "confidential information is protected" — LUKS on host disk protects all KCore state
- PCI DSS 2.2: "system hardening" — LUKS is a general hardening control; PCI 3.5 does not apply because KCore does not store cardholder data

**Effort estimate:** Documentation only. No engineering required.

### 2.6 Certificate lifecycle management (SOC 2, PCI, NCSC)

Certificates currently have no rotation or revocation workflow. Auditors will flag this.

**What to build:**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `kctl cluster rotate-certs` | Generates new certificates, distributes them to nodes, gracefully transitions connections |
| Expiry monitoring | Controller checks certificate expiry on every heartbeat. Emits warnings at 30/7/1 days before expiry via structured log events. |
| `kctl cluster cert-status` | Shows all certificates in the cluster, their expiry dates, and health status |

**Why this matters for customers:**
- SOC 2 CC6.1: "Logical access security — encryption key management"
- PCI DSS 3.6: "Key management procedures"
- NCSC Principle 10: "Identity and authentication"

**Effort estimate:** 2–3 weeks engineering.

### 2.7 Health checks and availability monitoring (SOC 2, NCSC)

**What to build:**

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| gRPC health checks | Implement `grpc.health.v1.Health` on controller and node-agent |
| Heartbeat failure alerting | Emit structured alert events when a node misses heartbeats. Optionally call a webhook. |
| `kctl cluster health` | Shows controller health, node health, and any active alerts |

**Why this matters for customers:**
- SOC 2 A1: "System availability meets the entity's objectives"
- NCSC Principle 2: "Asset protection and resilience"

**Effort estimate:** 1 week engineering.

### 2.8 Shared responsibility documentation

This is the single most important non-engineering deliverable. Customers need a clear document that tells them: "KCore handles X. You are responsible for Y."

**What to write:**

| Control area | KCore responsibility | Customer responsibility |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Encryption in transit | mTLS on all management traffic | Encryption of guest-to-guest and guest-to-internet traffic |
| Encryption at rest | LUKS reference NixOS configuration, certificate file permissions (0600) | Full-disk encryption on nodes (LUKS), guest disk encryption for VMs with sensitive data |
| Access control | CN-based RBAC on gRPC API, node approval queue | Managing who holds which certificates, revoking access for departed staff |
| Network segmentation | Per-VM network isolation, VLAN, firewall rules | Defining which workloads go on which networks, designing the topology |
| Audit logging | Structured audit log of all API actions | Forwarding audit logs to SIEM, setting retention policies, monitoring alerts |
| Patch management | `cargo audit`, SBOM, NixOS atomic updates | Applying updates to KCore nodes, patching guest OS images |
| VM security | Hypervisor isolation, TAP separation, config injection prevention | Hardening guest OS, application security, vulnerability scanning inside VMs |
| Backup and recovery | `kctl cluster backup` for controller state | Backing up VM data, testing recovery procedures |
| Incident response | Audit trail, structured logging, alert webhooks | Defining incident response procedures, staffing on-call, notifying regulators |
| Physical security | Not applicable (KCore is software) | Data center physical security, hardware tamper protection |
| Compliance certification | Compliance-enabling controls, evidence export, documentation | Engaging auditors, maintaining certifications, producing compliance reports |

**Effort estimate:** 1 week to write. No external cost.

## 3. Mapping to specific standards

### 3.1 GDPR enablement

GDPR does not certify infrastructure — it applies to organizations processing personal data. KCore enables the customer's GDPR posture.

| GDPR Article | What KCore provides | What customer does |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Art. 5 (data minimization) | KCore stores only operational data (node IPs, hostnames, cert CNs). No user data. | Customer ensures their VMs comply with data minimization |
| Art. 25 (privacy by design) | No telemetry, no phone-home, no data leaves the cluster | Customer documents their own privacy-by-design measures |
| Art. 30 (records of processing) | Audit log API, data inventory export | Customer maintains their ROPA using KCore's exports |
| Art. 32 (security of processing) | mTLS, RBAC, encryption at rest, VM isolation | Customer applies these controls and documents them |
| Art. 33 (breach notification) | Audit trail enables forensic investigation of when/how a breach occurred | Customer notifies supervisory authority within 72 hours |
| Art. 35 (DPIA) | Not required for KCore itself (no high-risk processing) | Customer performs DPIA for their workloads if required |

**Customer's cost to achieve GDPR using KCore:** €2,000–€5,000 for legal documentation (DPA, privacy policy). Most technical controls come from KCore itself.

### 3.2 SOC 2 Type II enablement

The customer gets audited, not KCore. KCore's controls count as "complementary subservice organization controls" in the customer's SOC 2 report.

| Trust Services Criteria | KCore provides (platform controls) | Customer provides (user entity controls) |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| CC6.1 (encryption) | mTLS, FIPS-validated crypto (aws-lc-rs), LUKS reference config | Key management procedures, enabling LUKS on nodes, guest encryption |
| CC6.3 (access control) | RBAC with three roles, node approval | Managing certificate distribution, offboarding |
| CC7.2 (monitoring) | Structured audit logging, audit log API | SIEM integration, alert triage, incident response |
| CC8.1 (change management) | Declarative NixOS config, SBOM, signed releases | Change approval workflow, deployment procedures |
| A1.2 (availability) | Health checks, heartbeat monitoring, node drain | SLA definition, redundancy planning, DR testing |
| C1.1 (confidentiality) | Network segmentation, encryption at rest | Data classification, secrets management in VMs |
| PI1.1 (processing integrity) | Input validation, config checksums | Application-level validation, data integrity checks |

**Customer's cost to achieve SOC 2 using KCore:** $20,000–$50,000 year 1 (auditor + compliance platform). KCore's compliance report export (2.2) significantly reduces evidence-gathering effort.

### 3.3 PCI DSS 4.0 enablement

PCI applies only if the customer's VMs process cardholder data. KCore is an "in-scope system component" in the customer's CDE.

| PCI Requirement | KCore provides | Customer provides |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1.3 (network segmentation) | NAT/VLAN/VXLAN network isolation, per-network firewall rules | Define which networks are PCI scope, validate segmentation |
| 2.2 (system hardening) | NixOS minimal install, no unnecessary services | Guest OS hardening, application hardening |
| 4.2 (strong cryptography) | mTLS with FIPS-approved cipher suites (always active) | Verify crypto config via `kctl get compliance-report`, document in security policy |
| 6.3 (software inventory) | SBOM shipped with every release | Vulnerability management workflow using the SBOM |
| 7.1 (restrict access) | RBAC with admin/operator/viewer roles | Map roles to staff, review access quarterly |
| 8.3 (MFA) | Client certificate on hardware token (YubiKey/PIV support) | Enforce hardware token usage, manage token inventory |
| 10.2 (audit trails) | Structured audit logging with tamper-evident option | Forward to SIEM, retain for 12 months, review daily |
| 11.5 (file integrity) | NixOS immutable store, config generation checksums | Monitor for unauthorized changes, investigate alerts |

**Customer's cost to achieve PCI using KCore:** $40,000–$100,000 year 1 (QSA + scanning + pen test). KCore reduces scope by providing platform-level controls out of the box.

### 3.4 FIPS 140-3 enablement

The customer's system must use FIPS-validated cryptography. KCore enables this without being FIPS-certified itself.

| Component | KCore provides | Customer provides |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| TLS library | `aws-lc-rs` (FIPS 140-3 certificate #4816) as `rustls` backend — enabled by default, no flag needed | Verify cipher suites via `kctl get compliance-report` |
| Cipher suites | FIPS-approved only (AES-GCM + ECDHE P-256/P-384) — always active, non-FIPS algorithms excluded at startup | Document the crypto configuration in their security policy |
| Key management | Certificate generation, sub-CA rotation, auto-renewal, and destruction tools | Follow key management procedures, protect root CA key |
| Kernel crypto | Documentation for `fips=1` kernel parameter on NixOS | Enable kernel FIPS mode on all nodes |
| Encryption at rest | LUKS reference NixOS configuration (dm-crypt uses kernel FIPS module when `fips=1` is set) | Enable LUKS on all nodes |

**Customer's cost to claim FIPS-compliant stack:** $0 external cost. KCore uses `aws-lc-rs` with FIPS-approved algorithms by default — no `--fips` flag or opt-in required. The customer documents the validated module and its certificate number in their own FIPS security policy. KCore does not need its own FIPS certificate.

---

## 4. API capabilities for compliance

### 4.1 Existing gRPC APIs useful for compliance

### 4.3 Webhook / event system

For customers integrating KCore with their SIEM, monitoring, or ticketing systems:

| Event | Trigger | Payload |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `audit.event` | Every state-changing API call | Full audit event record |
| `node.heartbeat.missed` | Node misses heartbeat threshold | Node ID, last seen, duration |
| `cert.expiry.warning` | Certificate approaching expiry | Certificate CN, expiry date, days remaining |
| `node.registered` | New node registers | Node ID, hostname, approval status |
| `vm.state.changed` | VM transitions state | VM ID, old state, new state, actor |

Webhook configuration in controller.yaml:

```yaml
webhooks:
  - url: https://customer-siem.example.com/kcore
    events: ["audit.event", "node.heartbeat.missed", "cert.expiry.warning"]
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
```
