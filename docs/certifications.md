# Certifications and Compliance Roadmap

This document lays out a practical roadmap for achieving GDPR, SOC 2 Type II, PCI DSS, FIPS 140-3, VS-NfD, UK Cyber Essentials Plus / NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and SBOM compliance in kcore. Each section describes what the standard requires, what kcore already provides, the gaps, and the concrete work items to close them.

## Current baseline

kcore already implements several controls that are prerequisites across multiple standards:

- **mTLS everywhere** — all inter-component communication (kctl, controller, node-agent) uses mutual TLS with a self-managed CA
- **CN-based gRPC authorization** — every RPC method enforces caller identity via certificate Common Name
- **Private key protection** — key files written with mode `0o600`, CA key never leaves the operator machine
- **Input sanitization** — Nix injection prevention via `nix_escape()` and `sanitize_nix_attr_key()`
- **Dependency auditing** — `cargo audit` runs as part of `make check`
- **Declarative infrastructure** — NixOS provides reproducible, auditable system configurations
- **No unsafe code** — the entire codebase runs within Rust's safety guarantees

---

## 1. SBOM — Software Bill of Materials

**Goal:** Ship a machine-readable SBOM with every kcore release so downstream consumers can track components, licenses, and vulnerabilities.

### What is needed

An SBOM in a standard format (SPDX or CycloneDX) listing every dependency (Rust crates, Nix packages, system libraries, VM images) included in a release artifact.

### Work items

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 1.1 | Add `cargo-sbom` or `cargo-cyclonedx` to the Nix dev shell | Generates a CycloneDX JSON from `Cargo.lock` at build time |
| 1.2 | Create a Makefile target `make sbom` | Runs the generator and writes `sbom.cdx.json` into the release directory |
| 1.3 | Integrate SBOM generation into the ISO build | The NixOS ISO build (`build-iso.sh` / flake) should embed the SBOM inside the image at a well-known path (e.g., `/etc/kcore/sbom.cdx.json`) |
| 1.4 | Add Nix-level SBOM | Use `nix-sbom` or a custom derivation to capture the full Nix closure (system packages, firmware, kernel modules) and merge it with the Cargo-level SBOM |
| 1.5 | Expose SBOM via `kctl` | Add a `kctl cluster sbom` command that retrieves and prints the SBOM from a running controller or local build |
| 1.6 | Automate SBOM diff on release | CI compares the new SBOM against the previous release and flags added/removed/upgraded dependencies in the release notes |
| 1.7 | License compliance check | Integrate `cargo-deny` to enforce an allowlist of acceptable licenses and flag copyleft or unknown licenses in the dependency tree |

### Priority

**High — do this first.** SBOM is a prerequisite for PCI DSS 4.0 (Requirement 6.3.2), helps with SOC 2 vendor management, and is increasingly required by enterprise procurement. It is also the lowest-effort item on this list.

---

## 2. FIPS 140-3 — Cryptographic Module Compliance

**Goal:** Run kcore on a FIPS 140-3 validated operating environment so that all cryptographic operations (TLS, certificate generation, hashing) use FIPS-approved algorithms and validated implementations.

### Current state

kcore uses `ring` (via `rustls` and `rcgen`) for all cryptographic operations. `ring` uses BoringSSL's cryptographic core internally, which has a FIPS-validated variant (BoringCrypto), but the `ring` crate itself is **not** FIPS-validated.

### Work items

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 2.1 | Evaluate `rustls` with `aws-lc-rs` backend | `aws-lc-rs` wraps AWS-LC, which has an active FIPS 140-3 validation (certificate #4816). `rustls` supports `aws-lc-rs` as a pluggable crypto provider. Switch from `ring` to `aws-lc-rs` for TLS. |
| 2.2 | Switch `rcgen` to use FIPS-validated primitives | `rcgen` 0.14+ supports pluggable crypto backends. Evaluate whether it can use `aws-lc-rs` for certificate generation, or wrap certificate generation in OpenSSL FIPS calls. |
| 2.3 | Kernel-level FIPS mode | Configure the NixOS kernel with `fips=1` boot parameter. This enables the kernel's FIPS mode, which restricts `/dev/random`, disables non-approved algorithms in the kernel crypto API, and runs power-on self-tests. |
| 2.4 | Disable non-FIPS TLS cipher suites | Configure `rustls` to only offer FIPS-approved cipher suites: TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM + ECDHE (P-256/P-384), TLS 1.3 with AES-128-GCM/AES-256-GCM. Disable ChaCha20-Poly1305 (not FIPS-approved). |
| 2.5 | Add `--fips` flag to controller and node-agent | When set, restrict cipher suites, reject non-FIPS key sizes, and log the FIPS mode status at startup. Fail to start if the crypto provider's self-test fails. |
| 2.6 | Document the FIPS boundary | Produce a FIPS security policy document describing the cryptographic boundary: what modules are validated, what algorithms are used, what keys exist, and how they are protected. |
| 2.7 | Automated FIPS regression tests | Add CI tests that start the controller and node-agent with `--fips`, perform a TLS handshake, and verify that only approved cipher suites were negotiated. |

### Priority

**Medium-high.** Required for US federal and financial-sector deployments. The `aws-lc-rs` migration (2.1) is the critical path — everything else follows from it.

---

## 3. GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation

**Goal:** Ensure kcore can be deployed in environments that process EU personal data, and that kcore itself does not create GDPR liability.

### Scope assessment

kcore is infrastructure software that manages VMs. It does **not** process end-user personal data directly. However:

- kcore **does** store operator-level data: node hostnames, IP addresses, certificate CNs, and audit logs
- kcore-managed VMs **may** process personal data — kcore must not interfere with the data subject's rights
- NixOS configurations generated by kcore are stored on disk and may reference identifiable infrastructure

### Work items

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 3.1 | Data inventory | Document exactly what data kcore stores (SQLite tables, certificate files, log files, Nix configs), classify each field as personal/non-personal per GDPR Article 4, and record retention periods |
| 3.2 | Audit logging | Add structured audit logs for all state-changing operations (VM create/delete, node register/deregister, config apply). Each log entry must include: timestamp, actor identity (CN), action, target resource, and outcome. Store in append-only format. |
| 3.3 | Log retention and rotation | Implement configurable log retention with automatic purging. Default to 90 days. Ensure deleted logs cannot be recovered (overwrite or use encrypted storage with key destruction). |
| 3.4 | Data subject access and erasure for operator data | Implement `kctl cluster purge-node <node>` that removes all traces of a node from the database, logs, and generated configs. Document the process for responding to a data access request about operator-identifiable information. |
| 3.5 | Encryption at rest | Encrypt the SQLite database at rest using SQLCipher or a dm-crypt volume. Certificate private keys are already permission-restricted but should also reside on an encrypted filesystem. |
| 3.6 | Data Processing Agreement template | Provide a DPA template in `docs/` that kcore operators can use with their own customers, clarifying that kcore is a processor/sub-processor and describing the technical measures in place. |
| 3.7 | Privacy by design documentation | Document the data minimization principles applied: kcore stores only the data necessary for VM orchestration, does not store VM contents or guest OS data, and does not phone home or transmit telemetry. |

### Priority

**Medium.** GDPR applies immediately if kcore is deployed in the EU. Items 3.1 and 3.2 should be done early because they are also prerequisites for SOC 2.

---

## 4. SOC 2 Type II

**Goal:** Demonstrate that kcore meets the Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy) through sustained, auditable controls over a review period (typically 6–12 months).

### What SOC 2 Type II requires

Unlike a point-in-time certification, SOC 2 Type II requires **evidence that controls operated effectively over time**. This means logging, monitoring, change management, and incident response — not just having the right code.

### Work items

#### Security (CC6 — Logical and Physical Access Controls)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.1 | Role-based access control | Extend the CN-based authorization model to support distinct roles (admin, operator, viewer) with different RPC permissions. Currently all kctl users have identical access. |
| 4.2 | Certificate lifecycle management | Implement certificate rotation: `kctl cluster rotate-certs` that generates new certs, distributes them to nodes, and revokes the old ones. Add expiry monitoring with warnings at 30/7/1 days before expiry. |
| 4.3 | Session and connection logging | Log every gRPC connection: source IP, certificate CN, connection time, and disconnection time. Store alongside audit logs from 3.2. |

#### Availability (A1 — System Availability)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.4 | Health check endpoints | Add gRPC health checking protocol support (`grpc.health.v1.Health`) to controller and node-agent. Expose readiness and liveness probes. |
| 4.5 | Heartbeat failure alerting | When a node misses heartbeats beyond the threshold, emit a structured alert event (log + optional webhook). Document the expected availability SLA. |
| 4.6 | Backup and recovery | Implement `kctl cluster backup` that snapshots the SQLite database and certificate store. Document the recovery procedure and test it. |

#### Processing Integrity (PI1 — Completeness and Accuracy)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.7 | Config generation checksums | After generating a Nix config, compute and store a SHA-256 hash. The node-agent should verify the hash before applying. This ensures configs are not tampered with in transit (defense in depth beyond mTLS). |
| 4.8 | Idempotent apply with generation counters | Add a monotonic generation counter to each config push. Node-agent rejects configs with a generation counter less than or equal to the currently applied one. Prevents replay and stale-config bugs. |

#### Confidentiality (C1 — Protection of Confidential Information)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.9 | Secrets management | VM cloud-init configs may contain sensitive data (passwords, SSH keys). Ensure these are encrypted at rest in the database and only decrypted during Nix config generation. |
| 4.10 | Network segmentation documentation | Document the expected network architecture: management plane (gRPC between controller/nodes/kctl) vs. data plane (VM traffic). Provide reference NixOS firewall rules. |

#### Change Management (CC8)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.11 | Signed releases | Sign release binaries and ISO images with a GPG or Sigstore key. Publish the public key in the repository. |
| 4.12 | Change log automation | Generate a changelog from conventional commits. Include in each release alongside the SBOM. |

#### Monitoring and Incident Response (CC7)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.13 | Structured logging with levels | Standardize all logging to structured JSON format with consistent fields (timestamp, level, component, message, trace_id). |
| 4.14 | Incident response runbook | Document how to respond to: compromised node certificate, unauthorized API access, failed config apply, data corruption in SQLite. |

### Priority

**Medium-high.** SOC 2 is the most-requested compliance standard for B2B infrastructure software. Start the audit period as soon as items 3.2, 4.1–4.3, and 4.13 are in place — the clock starts when controls are operating, and the audit needs 6–12 months of evidence.

---

## 5. PCI DSS 4.0 — Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

**Goal:** Enable kcore to host VMs that are in scope for PCI DSS compliance (e.g., VMs running payment processing applications).

### Scope

kcore itself does not handle cardholder data, but as the hypervisor management layer it is part of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) if any managed VM processes payment data. PCI DSS 4.0 Requirements that apply to kcore as a system component:

### Work items

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 5.1 | Network segmentation enforcement | Implement network policies that isolate PCI-scoped VMs from non-PCI VMs at the network level. This means separate bridge networks, firewall rules, and potentially separate physical nodes. Add `pci_scope: bool` to VM metadata. |
| 5.2 | Access control with MFA | PCI Requirement 8.3: multi-factor authentication for all administrative access. Integrate kctl with an external MFA provider (e.g., TOTP via a PAM module, or client certificate + hardware token). |
| 5.3 | Vulnerability management | PCI Requirement 6.3: maintain an inventory of custom and third-party software components (covered by SBOM — item 1.x). Add automated vulnerability scanning of the SBOM against NVD/OSV databases in CI. |
| 5.4 | File integrity monitoring | PCI Requirement 11.5: detect unauthorized changes to critical system files. Implement FIM for `/etc/nixos/`, `/etc/kcore/`, and kcore binaries. NixOS's immutable store helps here — alert if any store path is modified outside of `nixos-rebuild`. |
| 5.5 | Penetration testing support | PCI Requirement 11.4: regular penetration testing. Document the attack surface (gRPC endpoints, node-agent API, NixOS management interface) and provide a testing guide for assessors. |
| 5.6 | Audit trail with tamper detection | PCI Requirement 10: log all access to system components. Extend audit logging (3.2) with tamper-evident properties: hash-chain each log entry so that deletion or modification of historical entries is detectable. |
| 5.7 | Clock synchronization | PCI Requirement 10.6: synchronize clocks. Document NTP/chrony configuration requirements for kcore nodes and verify synchronization in heartbeat responses. |

### Priority

**Lower.** PCI compliance is only relevant if kcore is used to host payment workloads. Many items overlap with SOC 2 (audit logging, access control, change management). Address PCI-specific items (5.1, 5.2, 5.6) after the SOC 2 foundation is in place.

---

## 6. VS-NfD — Verschlusssache, Nur für den Dienstgebrauch

**Goal:** Enable kcore to be approved by the BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) for processing data classified as VS-NfD under the German Verschlusssachenanweisung (VSA), opening the door to German federal government, defense, and critical infrastructure deployments.

### What VS-NfD is

VS-NfD ("Classified — For Official Use Only") is the lowest German government classification level. Any IT system that processes, stores, or transmits VS-NfD data must meet BSI requirements and undergo either a conventional approval procedure or the BSI's qualified approval procedure. For hypervisors specifically, BSI-VS-AP-0019-2020 defines the requirements profile.

### Why it matters for kcore

kcore is a hypervisor management layer built on cloud-hypervisor and NixOS. If kcore-managed VMs process VS-NfD data, both the hypervisor (cloud-hypervisor) and its management plane (kcore) fall within the approval boundary. The BSI hypervisor profile requires strict VM isolation, minimal attack surface, auditability, and BSI-approved cryptography — requirements that align closely with kcore's existing architecture but need formal evidence and hardening.

### Cyberus Hypervisor (under evaluation)

[Cyberus Technology](https://cyberus-technology.de/en/products/hypervisor) offers the Cyberus Hypervisor, a hardened distribution of cloud-hypervisor and KVM that is currently in the BSI accreditation process for VS-NfD. Since kcore already uses cloud-hypervisor, the Cyberus Hypervisor is being evaluated as a potential drop-in replacement for VS-NfD deployments. No integration decision has been made yet.

### Current state

kcore has several properties the BSI values:

- **Rust with no unsafe code** — eliminates memory-safety vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free) that are a primary concern in the hypervisor profile
- **Declarative NixOS base** — reproducible builds, minimal attack surface, auditable system configuration
- **mTLS with certificate-based identity** — strong authentication on all management interfaces
- **No telemetry, no phone-home** — data stays within the operator's boundary

What is missing: BSI-approved cryptography, formal VM isolation evidence, BSI-mandated audit logging, and the accreditation process itself.

### Work items

#### Cryptography (BSI TR-02102 compliance)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.1 | Align TLS with BSI TR-02102-2 | BSI's technical guideline for TLS mandates specific cipher suites. Restrict kcore to: TLS 1.2 with ECDHE (brainpoolP256r1 or P-256) + AES-GCM, TLS 1.3 with AES-256-GCM. BSI prefers brainpool curves over NIST curves where possible. |
| 6.2 | Evaluate BSI-approved crypto libraries | The BSI maintains a list of approved crypto modules. Evaluate whether `aws-lc-rs` (from FIPS work item 2.1) or an OpenSSL-based variant with a BSI-evaluated configuration meets the requirement. If not, consider `botan-rs` (Botan has BSI evaluations). |
| 6.3 | Key management per BSI requirements | Document key generation, storage, distribution, rotation, and destruction procedures aligned with BSI TR-02102-1. Ensure key lengths meet BSI minimums (RSA >= 3000 bit, ECDSA >= 250 bit, AES >= 128 bit). |

#### VM isolation and hypervisor hardening

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.4 | Document cloud-hypervisor isolation properties | BSI-VS-AP-0019 requires evidence that the hypervisor enforces strict separation between VMs. Document cloud-hypervisor's isolation model: virtio device separation, memory isolation via KVM, no shared filesystem by default, separate TAP devices per VM. |
| 6.5 | Minimize hypervisor attack surface | Audit cloud-hypervisor features enabled by kcore. Disable any unnecessary device emulation, paravirtual interfaces, or debug features. Document the resulting attack surface. |
| 6.6 | Prevent information flow between VMs | Verify and document that no side-channel or covert channel exists through kcore's management plane. Ensure VM names, states, and metadata from one VM are not observable by another VM's guest OS. |
| 6.7 | Memory scrubbing on VM termination | Ensure that when a VM is destroyed, its memory pages are zeroed before being returned to the host or allocated to another VM. Verify cloud-hypervisor and KVM behavior; add a kcore-level check if needed. |

#### Audit and accountability

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.8 | BSI-compliant audit logging | Extend audit logging (item 3.2) to meet BSI requirements: log all administrative actions, authentication events (success and failure), configuration changes, and VM lifecycle events. Logs must be tamper-evident and retained for a defined period. |
| 6.9 | Audit log export in BSI-compatible format | Provide log export in a format consumable by BSI-approved SIEM systems. Structured JSON with fields aligned to BSI IT-Grundschutz OPS.1.1.5 (logging). |

#### Self-accreditation and documentation

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.10 | IT-Grundschutz baseline mapping | Map kcore's controls to the BSI IT-Grundschutz Compendium modules: SYS.1.5 (Virtualization), APP.6 (General Software), OPS.1.1.5 (Logging), CON.1 (Crypto Concept). Identify and document coverage vs. gaps. |
| 6.11 | Prepare VS-NfD self-accreditation package | Since September 2025, organizations processing VS-NfD must perform self-accreditation every three years. Produce the required documentation: security concept, risk assessment, list of technical and organizational measures, and the written confirmation from the IT security officer. |
| 6.12 | Engage BSI for qualified approval | Contact the BSI to initiate either the conventional or qualified approval procedure for kcore as a hypervisor management component. The qualified procedure evaluates development processes (based on Common Criteria) rather than only the final product. |
| 6.13 | Common Criteria evaluation preparation | The BSI qualified procedure requires development process evidence aligned with Common Criteria. Document: security target (ST), functional specification, design documentation, test documentation, and vulnerability analysis. The Rust + NixOS toolchain provides strong evidence for development environment security. |

#### NixOS-level hardening

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 6.14 | Hardened NixOS profile for VS-NfD | Create a NixOS configuration profile that meets BSI SiM-08202 (minimum security requirements for federal workstations). Includes: mandatory access control (SELinux or AppArmor), disabled USB mass storage, locked bootloader, kernel hardening (`lockdown=confidentiality`), no network services except kcore. |
| 6.15 | Verified boot chain | Implement Secure Boot with a custom Machine Owner Key (MOK) for the kcore NixOS image. The BSI requires boot integrity verification to prevent rootkits and boot-time tampering. |

### Priority

**Medium.** Required for any German government or defense-adjacent deployment. Significant overlap with FIPS (cryptography) and SOC 2 (audit logging, access control). The BSI approval process itself can take 12–24 months, so early engagement (6.12) is critical path. The self-accreditation requirement (6.11) is mandatory since September 2025 and should be addressed promptly if kcore is already deployed in a VS-NfD environment.

---

## 7. UK — Cyber Essentials, NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and UK GDPR

**Goal:** Enable kcore to be used by UK government departments, NHS bodies, and their suppliers for workloads classified at OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, and ensure compliance with UK data protection law.

### What is required

Unlike a single certification, the UK landscape is a combination of:

- **Cyber Essentials / Cyber Essentials Plus** — mandatory for UK government suppliers handling personal data or OFFICIAL data (required since February 2025). From April 2026, v3.3 explicitly brings cloud services into scope and makes MFA mandatory.
- **NCSC 14 Cloud Security Principles** — the framework UK government buyers use to evaluate cloud and infrastructure services. Not a pass/fail certification, but alignment must be demonstrated for G-Cloud or Digital Marketplace listings.
- **NCSC Virtualisation Security Design Principles** — dedicated NCSC guidance for hypervisor and orchestration security, directly applicable to kcore.
- **UK GDPR / Data (Use and Access) Act 2025** — the UK's post-Brexit data protection regime, now diverging from EU GDPR via the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (Royal Assent June 2025).

### Current state

kcore's existing controls map well to the UK requirements:

- mTLS and CN-based authorization satisfy NCSC Principle 9 (secure user management) and Principle 10 (identity and authentication)
- NixOS declarative configuration supports Principle 5 (operational security) and Principle 6 (personnel security — auditable, reproducible systems)
- VM isolation via cloud-hypervisor/KVM aligns with Principle 3 (separation between consumers) and the virtualisation design principles
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) meets Principle 2 (asset protection and resilience)

What is missing: MFA support (mandatory under Cyber Essentials v3.3), formal NCSC Principles alignment documentation, UK GDPR-specific data handling adjustments, and Cyber Essentials Plus certification itself.

### Work items

#### Cyber Essentials Plus (CE+)

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.1 | Firewalls and internet gateways | Document and verify that kcore nodes expose only the required ports (gRPC management, VM networking). Provide reference NixOS firewall configuration that meets CE+ requirements. |
| 7.2 | Secure configuration | Document the hardening applied by the kcore NixOS ISO: no default passwords, disabled unnecessary services, no default accounts. Ensure kcore binaries run as non-root where possible. |
| 7.3 | Patch management | Implement and document a patching process for kcore nodes. NixOS `nixos-rebuild` provides atomic updates — document the expected patch cadence and how `cargo audit` / SBOM (section 1) feed into it. |
| 7.4 | Access control with MFA | CE+ v3.3 (April 2026) makes MFA mandatory for cloud service access. Implement MFA for kctl authentication — options include client certificate on a hardware token (YubiKey/PIV), TOTP as a second factor alongside the client cert, or integration with an external IdP that enforces MFA. |
| 7.5 | Malware protection | Document how kcore's architecture provides malware resilience: read-only NixOS store, no arbitrary code execution on the management plane, signed and reproducible builds. If CE+ assessors require endpoint protection, document the NixOS-compatible options (ClamAV, YARA rules). |
| 7.6 | Obtain CE+ certification | Engage an NCSC-authorised CE+ assessor to perform the technical audit. The assessor will test the five control themes against a live kcore deployment. |

#### NCSC 14 Cloud Security Principles

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.7 | Principles alignment document | Produce a document mapping each of the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles to kcore's controls, with evidence references. This is the standard format UK government buyers expect. |
| 7.8 | Principle 3 — Separation between consumers | Document cloud-hypervisor's VM isolation model, kcore's per-VM network separation (separate bridges, TAP devices, firewall rules), and management plane authorization that prevents cross-tenant visibility. |
| 7.9 | Principle 5 — Operational security | Demonstrate vulnerability management (cargo audit, SBOM scanning), protective monitoring (audit logging from 3.2), incident management (runbook from 4.14), and configuration management (NixOS declarative config). |
| 7.10 | Principle 12 — Audit information for consumers | Expose audit logs to operators so they can meet their own compliance obligations. Implement `kctl cluster audit-log` to retrieve and export audit events. |
| 7.11 | NCSC Virtualisation Security Design Principles review | Review kcore against the NCSC's [virtualisation security design principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cyber-security-design-principles/virtualisation-security-design-principles). Document how kcore addresses: hypervisor attack surface, management plane isolation, orchestration security, and guest-to-host breakout prevention. |

#### UK GDPR / Data (Use and Access) Act 2025

| # | Task | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| 7.12 | UK GDPR delta assessment | Review the EU GDPR work items (section 3) and identify UK-specific differences: ICO as supervisory authority, "Senior Responsible Individual" instead of DPO, updated rules on legitimate interests and automated decision-making under the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025. |
| 7.13 | UK-specific DPA template | Adapt the Data Processing Agreement template (item 3.6) for UK law, referencing the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) instead of EU Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers. |
| 7.14 | ICO registration guidance | Document that kcore operators processing personal data in the UK must register with the ICO. Provide guidance on which registration tier applies. |

### Priority

**Medium-high.** Cyber Essentials Plus is a hard gate for UK government procurement since February 2025, and v3.3 (April 2026) tightens requirements further. The NCSC Principles alignment document (7.7) is essential for any G-Cloud listing. Most work items overlap with existing SOC 2 and GDPR efforts — the UK-specific incremental effort is modest once those foundations are in place.

## Estimated total effort

| Phase | Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 — Foundation | 2–3 weeks | None |
| 2 — Crypto hardening | 3–4 weeks | Phase 1 |
| 3 — Access & lifecycle | 3–4 weeks | Phase 1 |
| 4 — Integrity & change mgmt | 2–3 weeks | Phases 2, 3 |
| 5 — VS-NfD hypervisor hardening | 3–4 weeks | Phases 2, 4 |
| 6 — SOC 2 audit period | 6–12 months (elapsed) | Phase 4 |
| 7 — PCI-specific | 3–4 weeks | Phase 4 |
| 8 — VS-NfD accreditation | 4–6 weeks + BSI lead time | Phase 5 |
| 9 — UK certification | 2–3 weeks | Phases 1, 3 |
| 10 — Certification | 2–6 months (elapsed) | Phases 6–9 |

Total engineering effort: approximately 6–7 months of focused work, spread across a 12–24 month calendar timeline driven by the SOC 2 observation period and the BSI approval process (which can take 12–24 months on its own). The UK certification (Phase 9) can run in parallel with phases 5–8 and has the shortest lead time since most controls overlap with SOC 2 and GDPR.
