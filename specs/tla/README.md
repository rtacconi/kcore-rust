# TLA+ Specs for HA Replication

This directory contains bounded TLA+ models for HA/replication behavior.
The intent is to check protocol-level safety/liveness properties with TLC.

- controller fallback/heartbeat progression
- replication convergence under anti-entropy
- cross-DC eventual convergence assumptions

## Files

- `ControllerNodeReconcile.tla` + `ControllerNodeReconcile.cfg`
  - Node-agent picks an active controller from an ordered list.
  - If active controller is down, it rotates to another reachable controller.
  - Heartbeats only target the active controller.

- `ControllerReplication.tla` + `ControllerReplication.cfg`
  - Controller-to-controller replication model.
  - Checks event propagation safety and eventual convergence assumptions.

- `CrossDcReplication.tla` + `CrossDcReplication.cfg`
  - Three controllers across two DCs.
  - Models inter-DC synchronization with bounded anti-entropy checks.

## Running locally

Preferred:

```bash
make test-tla
```

Direct:

```bash
bash ./scripts/check-tla.sh
```

If TLC is not in `PATH`, set one of:

- `TLC_CMD` (full command to run TLC)
- `TLA2TOOLS_JAR` (path to `tla2tools.jar`)

Notes:

- These specs are intentionally bounded; they are guardrails, not full proofs.
- The model captures protocol-level expectations, not Rust implementation details.
